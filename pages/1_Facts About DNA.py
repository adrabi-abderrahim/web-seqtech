  <p>Here are some interesting facts about DNA:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>DNA stands for Deoxyribonucleic Acid.</li>
            <li>It contains the genetic instructions used in the development and functioning of all known living organisms.</li>
            <li>DNA is a double-stranded molecule that resembles a twisted ladder or helix.</li>
            <li>Each strand of DNA consists of a sequence of nucleotides, represented by the letters A, T, C, and G, which stand for Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine, and Guanine, respectively.</li>
            <li>Adenine pairs with Thymine, and Cytosine pairs with Guanine, forming the complementary base pairs in DNA.</li>
			<li>DNA is found in the nucleus of cells.</li>
			<li>It carries the hereditary information that is passed from parents to offspring.</li>
			<li>DNA replication is the process by which DNA makes copies of itself during cell division.</li>
			<li>Mutations in DNA can lead to genetic variations and are the basis of evolution.</li>
			<li>DNA sequencing allows scientists to determine the precise order of nucleotides in a DNA molecule.</li>
        </ul>
